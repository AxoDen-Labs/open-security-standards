### AxoDen Labs introduces a new discipline in security architecture
Coprime-Factor Security — where defense layers are engineered to be mathematically independent in their failure modes, analogous to coprime factors in number theory.
Instead of traditional “defense-in-depth” that often hides shared dependencies, this architecture systematically eliminates common-mode risks across cryptography, trust roots, runtime environments, supply chains, and control planes.

**The objective is clear:**
No single breach should improve the attacker’s odds against the rest of the system.
This release establishes the foundation for an open, measurable, and verifiable security standard grounded in mathematical independence and provable trust separation.

## Blueprint Overview — Coprime-Factor Security Architecture (v0.1)

The Coprime-Factor Security Architecture establishes a provable security model where each protection layer is engineered to be **mathematically independent**, eliminating shared catastrophic dependencies across:

* Cryptographic primitives and key sources
* Trust roots and signing authorities
* Runtime and operating environments
* Supply chain and build pipelines
* Policy engines and control planes
* Identity and access mechanisms

This moves beyond traditional “defense-in-depth” toward **measurable, independently hardened trust planes** inspired by coprime modular theory.

> **Goal:** Compromising one layer must not meaningfully increase the probability of compromising another.

### Core Principles

| Principle                 | Description                                             |
| ------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------- |
| Cryptographic diversity   | Independent algorithm families, RNGs, KMS/HSM vendors   |
| Split trust roots         | Separate HSMs/CA chains; no shared firmware line        |
| Dual-path authorization   | AND-consensus across distinct policy engines            |
| Runtime diversity         | microVMs + containers / SELinux; distinct kernel spaces |
| Supply-chain isolation    | Separate CI/CD, signing, provenance pipelines           |
| Independence scoring      | Formal IS + CMRI measurement targets                    |
| Tamper accountability     | Merkle audit logs + external anchoring                  |
| Failure-isolation testing | Red-team single-layer compromise exercises              |

### Metrics

| Metric                        | Target | Purpose                          |
| ----------------------------- | ------ | -------------------------------- |
| Independence Score (IS)       | ≥ 0.85 | Proves layer independence        |
| Common-Mode Risk Index (CMRI) | ≤ 0.10 | Limits shared dependency surface |

---

### Reference Architecture Elements

* AES-GCM + ChaCha20-Poly1305 (independent crypto tops)
* Independent HSM vendors & entropy sources
* FIDO2 + TOTP dual authentication
* OPA + Cedar authorization consensus (AND logic)
* Sigstore + internal CA for software trust
* microVM / Firecracker + SELinux container separation
* Internal append-only audit + external anchoring

---

### Named Engineering Patterns

| Pattern | Expansion                 |
| ------- | ------------------------- |
| DPE     | Dual-Primitive Encryption |
| DPC     | Dual Policy Consensus     |
| SVK     | Split-Vendor Key Ceremony |
| DT      | Divergent Transport       |
| TA      | Twin Attestation          |

---

### Rollout Stages

1. Measure baseline independence surface (IS / CMRI)
2. Introduce independent cryptographic and policy paths
3. Add split-vendor trust and attestation
4. Enforce independence gates for privileged operations
5. Automate audit + failure-isolation tests
