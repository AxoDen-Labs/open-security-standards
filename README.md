### AxoDen Labs introduces a new discipline in security architecture
Coprime-Factor Security — where defense layers are engineered to be mathematically independent in their failure modes, analogous to coprime factors in number theory.
Instead of traditional “defense-in-depth” that often hides shared dependencies, this architecture systematically eliminates common-mode risks across cryptography, trust roots, runtime environments, supply chains, and control planes.

**The objective is clear:**
No single breach should improve the attacker’s odds against the rest of the system.
This release establishes the foundation for an open, measurable, and verifiable security standard grounded in mathematical independence and provable trust separation.
