## Abstract
This publication introduces a cybersecurity architecture in which security layers are designed to be *mathematically independent* in their failure modes, analogous to coprime factors in number theory. The model ensures that compromise of one layer does not materially raise probability of compromise in another, reducing correlated risk and enabling quantified security independence.

## Key Claims (Released as Prior Art)
- Pairwise independence requirement across security layers  
- Independence Score (IS) & Common-Mode Risk Index (CMRI)  
- Dual-primitive cryptography with independent KMS/HSM roots  
- Dual policy-engine consensus for privileged actions  
- Split-vendor key ceremonies  
- Multi-root attestation  
- Divergent transport protections  
- Quantified defense-in-depth based on coprime analogy

## Implementation
